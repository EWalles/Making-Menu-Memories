      Meals are more than food, but about the memories associated with it. 
      From familys to single people, every bite reminds you of life.

      The purpose of this page and app is to add some variety. Each day has a button for you to click. This will give you a menu with recipes for that day. The calendar itself is done on a weekly basis. On the right a grocery list is generated based on the menu.
