    <h1>Menu Memories</h1>
    <div class= "container"> 
      Meals are more than food, but about the memories associated with it. 
      From familys to single people, every bite reminds you of life.
      <br>
      Now, what nobody told me is that as an adult you would spend the rest of your life eating your decisions. Everyday you have to make a choice of what to have for dinner. Sometimes, you fall into a rut and end up having the same meals over and over.
      <br>
      The purpose of this page and app is to add some variety. Each day has a button for you to click. This will give you a menu with recipes for that day. The calendar itself is done on a weekly basis. On the right a grocery list is generated based on the menu.
