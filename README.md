# Making-Menu-Memories

One of the things you're never warned about when growing up. 
Every day for the rest of your life you have to decide what to eat. 
Tired of the same old food I built this to pull up random recipes.

<ul>
<li>Menu
<li>Recipe
<li>Puppy Tax
</ul>

<h1>Next Steps in the future</h1>
<ul>
<li>Expand the ingredient list to build a grocery shopping list
<li>Include Drinks for the meals
<li> Maybe get youtube videos
</ul>
